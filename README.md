# flight-fare-prediction

The goal is to create a flight fare detection web application using streamlit.

The process involved:
* Creating the model.
* Creating the web app using streamlit.
* Deploying the model using Heroku.

There are various files to aid in this:
* **Procfile** - Specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.
* **setup.sh** - Serverside code.
* **app.py** - Streamlit web app code.
* **Flight_Fare_Prediction.ipynb** - Notebook containing code used to create the model.
* **forest.pkl** - Random Forest Regression model trained and evaluated.
* **requirements.txt** - The necessary libraries required.
* **Data_Train.xlsx** - Data used to train and evaluate the model ( It was split into three sets of data. View notebook for more info).
